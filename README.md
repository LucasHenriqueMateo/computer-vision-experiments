## ⚠️ Archived Repository

This repository contains **exploratory notebooks and experiments** focused on
**Computer Vision** tasks, including image processing and deep learning–based approaches.

The content represents an experimental and learning-oriented phase and **is not actively maintained nor intended to reflect production-ready projects**.

📌 **Complete and well-structured Computer Vision projects**, with clear objectives,
methodology, and results, are available in separate repositories on my GitHub profile.
